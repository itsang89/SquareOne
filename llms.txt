> Neumorphic expense tracking app built with React and Supabase.

## Core Files
- `App.tsx`: Main application entry point and routing configuration.
- `context/AppContext.tsx`: Primary state management for friends and transactions with real-time sync.
- `context/AuthContext.tsx`: Authentication state management using Supabase Auth.
- `utils/supabase.ts`: Supabase client initialization.
- `components/NeoComponents.tsx`: Core UI design system (Neumorphic style).

## Key Concepts
- **Neo-brutalism (Neo)**: The visual style of the app, characterized by bold black borders, high contrast, and a modern aesthetic.
- **Real-time Sync**: Data is kept in sync across clients using Supabase's PostgreSQL changes listener.
- **Friend Balances**: Calculated on the client side based on the full transaction history for each friend.
- **Guest Mode**: A fallback mode for users without an account, though primary functionality relies on Supabase.

## Tech Stack
- React 19 (Vite)
- TypeScript
- Supabase (Auth, DB, Real-time)
- React Router 7
- Lucide React (Icons)
- Recharts (Data Visualization)
